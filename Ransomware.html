            <h1>What is Ransomware?</h1>
            <p>"Ransomware is a malware designed to deny a user or organization access to files on their computer. By encrypting these files and demanding a ransom payment for the decryption key, 
            cyberattackers place organizations in a position where paying the ransom is the easiest and cheapest way to regain access to their files. Some variants have added additional functionality 
            such as data theft to provide further incentive for ransomware victims to pay the ransom."</p>

            <h1>Types of Ransomware</h1>
            <h3>Scareware</h3>
            <p>"Scareware, as it turns out, is not that scary. It includes rogue security software and tech support scams. You might receive a pop-up message claiming that malware was discovered and the only way to get rid of it is to pay up. 
                If you do nothing, you'll likely continue to be bombarded with pop-ups, but your files are essentially safe. A legitimate cybersecurity software program would not solicit customers in this way. 
                If you don't already have this company's software on your computer, then they would not be monitoring you for ransomware infection. If you do have security software, you wouldn't need to pay to have the infection removed—you've already paid for the software to do that very job."</p>
            <h3>Screen lockers</h3>
            <p>"Upgrade to terror alert orange for these guys. When lock-screen ransomware gets on your computer, it means you're frozen out of your PC entirely. 
                Upon starting up your computer, a full-size window will appear, often accompanied by an official-looking FBI or US Department of Justice seal saying illegal activity has been detected on your computer and you must pay a fine. However, the FBI would not freeze you out of your computer or demand payment for illegal activity. 
                If they suspected you of piracy, child pornography, or other cybercrimes, they would go through the appropriate legal channels."</p>
            <h3>Encrypting ransomware</h3>
            <p>"This is the truly nasty stuff. These are the guys who snatch up your files and encrypt them, demanding payment in order to decrypt and redeliver. 
                The reason why this type of ransomware is so dangerous is because once cybercriminals get ahold of your files, no security software or system restore can return them to you. 
                Unless you pay the ransom—for the most part, they're gone. And even if you do pay up, there's no guarantee the cybercriminals will give you those files back."</p>
