            <h1>What is Phishing?</h1>
            <p>"Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution 
                to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.</p>
            <p>The information is then used to access important accounts and can result in identity theft and financial loss."</p>

            <h1>Types of Phishing Attaks</h1>
                <h3>Email phishing</h3>
                <p>"Most phishing attacks are sent by email. The crook will register a fake domain that mimics a genuine organisation and sends thousands of generic requests. 
                The fake domain often involves character substitution, like using 'r' and 'n' next to each other to create 'rn' instead of 'm'. 
                In other cases, the fraudsters create a unique domain that includes the legitimate organisation's name in the URL."</p>
                <h3>Spear phishing</h3>
                <p>"There are two other, more sophisticated, types of phishing involving email.
                The first, spear phishing, describes malicious emails sent to a specific person. Criminals who do this will already have some or all of the following information about the victim:"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Their name"</li>
                    <li>"Place of employment"</li>
                    <li>"Job title"</li>
                    <li>"Email address"</li>
                    <li>"Specific information about their job role"</li>
                </ul>     
                <h3>Whaling</h3>
                <p>"Whaling attacks are even more targeted, taking aim at senior executives. Although the end goal of whaling is the same as any other kind of phishing attack, the technique tends to be a lot subtler. 
                Tricks such as fake links and malicious URLs aren't helpful in this instance, as criminals are attempting to imitate senior staff.                   
                Whaling emails also commonly use the pretext of a busy CEO who wants an employee to do them a favour."</p>
                <h3>Smishing and vishing</h3>
                <p>"With both smishing and vishing, telephones replace emails as the method of communication.
                Smishing involves criminals sending text messages (the content of which is much the same as with email phishing), and vishing involves a telephone conversation.                   
                One of the most common smishing pretexts are messages supposedly from your bank alerting you to suspicious activity."</p>
                <h3>Angler phishing</h3>
                <p>"A relatively new attack vector, social media offers several ways for criminals to trick people. Fake URLs; cloned websites, posts, and tweets; and instant messaging 
                (which is essentially the same as smishing) can all be used to persuade people to divulge sensitive information or download malware. 
                Alternatively, criminals can use the data that people willingly post on social media to create highly targeted attacks."</p>
